# Code Rules

This is the rules for adding/modifying code in this project.

## Naming
Keep variable names in snake case and camel case for classes and structs.

For private vars start them with `_`.

## Syntax
Keep opening brackets same line.

### Comments
Do not do comments starting with `//` if they are multi-line!

If any of these rules are broken then your changes will be reverted or denied!

# Naming
### New files
For each new file, start it with this:


## Files
To support as much compilers as possible, don't use `#pragma once` in header files.

```cpp
/*
 * LTecher Adventure (c) 2024
 *
 * This file belongs to the LTecher Adventure project
 */

```

This is used for identification purposes.
