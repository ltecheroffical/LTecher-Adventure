# Code Rules

This is the rules for adding/modifying code in this project.

## Naming
Keep variable names in snake case and camel case for classes and structs.

For private vars start them with `_`.

## Syntax
Keep opening brackets same line and well as types.

### Comments
Do not do comments starting with `//` if they are multi-line!

If any of these rules are broken then your changes will be reverted or denied!

# Naming
### New files
For each new file, start it with this:


# Files
To support as much compilers as possible, don't use `#pragma once` in header files.

## File paths
For coding file paths use the unix style `/` instead of the windows style `\`.

When making single header file then put it in include/ instead of src/

# C vs C++

## File extensions
Any files that don't use C++ features must be with the C file extension.

Use the .h file extension for C and C++ headers.
